    "The concept of an abstract superclass, also known as an abstract base class (ABC), is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows the creation of classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract superclass defines a common interface and a set of methods that its subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the abc module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes. To create an abstract superclass, you need to subclass the ABC class from the abc module and use the @abstractmethod decorator to mark one or more methods as abstract. An abstract method is a method declaration without an implementation in the abstract superclass. Subclasses of the abstract superclass are then required to provide an implementation for the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an abstract superclass is to define a common interface and establish a contract that its subclasses must adhere to. It allows you to enforce certain behaviors and ensure that specific methods are implemented by the subclasses. Abstract superclasses are useful for creating generic functionality that can be extended and customized by different subclasses while maintaining a consistent interface."
